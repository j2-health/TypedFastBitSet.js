# TypedFastBitSet.js


Speed-optimized BitSet implementation for modern browsers and JavaScript engines, uses typed arrays

A BitSet (also called Bitmap or bit vector) is an ideal data structure to implement a
set when values being stored are reasonably small integers. It can be orders of magnitude
faster than a generic set implementation. In particular, a BitSet has fast support for set
operations (union, difference, intersection).

The TypedFastBitSet.js implementation optimizes for speed, leveraging commonly available features
like typed arrays. It can be several times faster than competitive alternatives. It is also entirely
dynamic, and has functions to minimize the memory usage. It should be supported by most of the modern
browsers and JavaScript engines. It is ideal for maintaining sets of integers when performance matters.

# Usage

```javascript
const b = new TypedFastBitSet(); // initially empty
b.add(1); // add the value "1"
b.has(1); // check that the value is present! (will return true)
b.add(2);
console.log("" + b); // should display {1,2}
b.add(10);
b.addRange(11, 13);
b.array(); // would return [1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13]
let c = new TypedFastBitSet([1, 2, 3, 10]); // create bitset initialized with values 1,2,3,10
c.difference(b); // from c, remove elements that are in b (modifies c)
c.difference2(b); // from c, remove elements that are in b (modifies b)
c.change(b); // c will contain all elements that are in b or in c, but not both (elements that changed)
const su = c.union_size(b); // compute the size of the union (bitsets are unchanged)
c.union(b); // c will contain all elements that are in c and b
const out1 = c.new_union(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything in c and b
const out2 = c.new_intersection(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything that is in both c and b
const out3 = c.new_change(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything in b or in c, but not both
const s1 = c.intersection_size(b); // compute the size of the intersection (bitsets are unchanged)
const s2 = c.difference_size(b); // compute the size of the difference (bitsets are unchanged)
const s3 = c.change_size(b); // compute the number of elements that are in b but not c, or vice versa
c.intersects(b); // return true if c intersects with b
c.intersection(b); // c will only contain elements that are in both c and b
c = b.clone(); // create a (deep) copy of b and assign it to c.
c.equals(b); // checks whether c and b are equal
c.forEach(fnc); // execute fnc on each value stored in c
for (const x of c) fnc(x); // execute fnc on each value stored in c (allows early exit with break)
c.trim(); // reduce the memory usage of the bitmap if possible, the content remains the same
```

If you are using node.js, you need to import the module:

```javascript
const TypedFastBitSet = require("typedfastbitset");
const b = new TypedFastBitSet(); // initially empty
b.add(1); // add the value "1"
```

Performance tip: in-place functions such as intersection, union and difference can be
much faster than functions generating a new bitmap (new_intersection, new_union
and new_difference) because they avoid creating a new object, a potentially
expensive process in JavaScript. For faster code, use as few FastBitSet objects as
you can.

There is also `SparseTypedFastBitSet` which might perform better depending on the shape of your data
This implementation starts as an array of values and switches to a bitset structure once enough entries have been added

# npm install

      $ npm install typedfastbitset

# Testing

Using node.js (npm), you can test the code as follows...

      $ npm test

# Is it faster?

To run benchmarks, please use the instructions in the benchmark folder.

TypedFastBitSet can be quite fast compared to competitive alternatives :
